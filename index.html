                <h3>Jeanne Roe Smith</h3>
                    <p>Although she serves as a campus minister serving the UCLA community, Jeanne Roe Smith describes her family growing up as &ldquo;unchurched.&rdquo; She said not only did her parents not identify with a religion, they bordered on skepticism with it.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;I was outside the church and saw it a s a bunch of rules and people who are either in or are out, and being told that if you are not in you are going to hell,&rdquo; Smith said. </p>

                    <p>It was only in college when she found a faith that looked and sounded like what she wanted. She calls what she found an &ldquo;engaged faith,&rdquo; one that did not advocate for blindly reading the words of the bible but instead actively thinking through it with a community. </p>

                    <p>She jokingly said she came to UCLA in 2009 because she refuses to grow up, but on a more serious note explained she likes working with college students because of the fertile opportunity it presents for exploring identity and what that means in the world. </p>

                    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s also about the curiosity and the compassion that students bring, and the intelligence of why. Not just to accept it and move on, but asking and questioning and engaging&rdquo; she said. </p>

                    <p>A guiding religious philosophy of Smith&rsquo;s is that all human life is sacred, and she engages in advocacy for groups that have historically been unwelcome in religious settings like members of the queer community. Two operating principles she has are do not harm and to love god. She sees the sometimes aggressive preaching done on Bruin Walk as harmful and inconsistent with encouraging people to want to know God. </p>

                    <p>&ldquo;Street preachers who use words and actions to diminish others and push them outside and demonize them or harm them -- not acceptable,&rdquo; she said.</p>

                <h3>Steven Mion</h3>
                    <p>When Steven Mion started going to a Methodist church in eighth grade, he went to attend the confirmation of his girlfriend with his parents. </p>

                    <p>Although the two broke up and he later came out as queer, he continued to attend church with his parents. He said at first he kept going to church because his parents were going, but that eventually he found a community at the church and was drawn to its message that fundamentally all people had worth and were of value. </p>

                    <p>When he came to UCLA he joined several queer focused fellowships, and said he prefers to talk about Christianity in these spaces because of a fundamental difference he sees between having a queer faith and what he called a &ldquo;hetero faith.&rdquo; </p>

                    <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to prove anything with a hetero faith. Having a queer faith is challenged all of the time,&rdquo; Mion said. </p>

                    <p>He said both of the fellowships he is in are only partially approved by the larger organizations they are under the umbrella of, and some think the role of these fellowships should be to provide therapy for those that are in them. </p>

                    <p>Despite pushback from some, Mion said there is an element of self discovery and and definition in being queer that he finds grounding in his faith. </p>

                    <p>&ldquo;God made me in God&rsquo;s image, and the way that God made me is I am queer,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Knowing that my queer image is just as validated by God as any other image is going to give me strength and resilience when in doubt.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>He was raised a Catholic, but said he never read the bible until after a truck driver made too wide a turn. </p>

                    <p>In 1997 his brother was going westbound in Compton when the driver struck him, dragging him twenty feet. His brother died four hours later in a nearby hospital he said. </p>

                    <p>It was after this experience that he began to read the bible and get involved in open air preaching. Almost two decades following the crash, he said he tries to come to UCLA at least once a month to save the souls of its student population. Whenever he comes, people know. He is hard to miss with the giant replica of the bible he carries with him, the orange jumpsuit he wears, and his loud preaching. </p>

                    <p>It&rsquo;s not just college campuses that he goes to-- he said his long term mission has brought him to venues in the larger Southern California area such as high schools and football games and even across state lines. He said he sees it as his responsibility to keep coming back to communities that do not embrace him, as is the case of the UCLA population who often heckle and argue with him when he comes to campus, because of the opportunity to save people from hell. He has described his mission of saving students in terms of a burning house. </p>

                    <p>&ldquo;A house is on fire, and people are asleep. God forbid that I would continue walking by that house. You would want to warn them, the inhabitants in there to get out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Even one soul, even one person, is worth coming here.&rdquo;</p>

    <!-- STORY -->

            <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">

                <h2>Story goes here</h2>

<p>                
The fight on Bruin Walk is against no less than eternal damnation. At least, that is how the many loosely connected contingents of preachers who make the journey to UCLA’s campus say they feel. 
</p>

<p>
For Isidro Mendozo, the fight began in 1997 when during his mid-30s he lost a brother to a car accident. Despite never having read the bible before, he said reading a copy of the New Testament after his death he said he miraculously found was the only thing that comforted him from grief that felt like someone had reached into his stomach and ripped his guts out. Reading the book initiated a born-again experience, and since then he has preached the word of the gospel. 
</p>

<p>
Armed with a 6-foot tall paper mâché replica of the bible he has been working on since 2008 and an orange prison jumpsuit he said he wears to symbolize humanity’s criminal nature in the eyes of God, Mendozo makes frequent trips to UCLA in an attempt to save the souls of its student population. He said that students who do not repent and follow the word of God will ultimately end up in Hell, and by preaching with the goal of converting students to his beliefs hopes to change their fate. 
</p>

<p>
“This world is contaminated by sin and I have the medicine for it, which is the word of God,” he said. “I would be the most wicked person on Earth if I was to hide it.” 
</p>

<p>
Many preachers who come to Bruin Walk share Mendozo’s mission to save the souls of passersby. Tony Miano, a member of Grace Community Church in Los Angeles who has come to preach said colleges campuses are an ideal place for preachers to do this work because on any given day they can reach tens of thousands of young people who are often willing to engage in conversation. 
</p>

<p>
In addition to college campuses,  Miano said the almost exclusively male groups of preachers coordinate to preach at other venues such as sporting events and large-scale award ceremonies like the Academy Awards. The preachers do not belong to an organized group or all go to the same church, and in fact many travel from across the country and world to preach with one another on campus. They meet through a variety of ways, including social media like Facebook and Twitter, cross-church events and religious conventions, he said.  
</p>

<p>
Those who preach practice a style of preaching Miano termed “open air preaching,” or heralding a religious message to a public audience instead of in a church. 
A number of UCLA students describe this style of preaching as alternately disruptive and entertaining.
</p>

<p>
“It’s a good study break to listen to them, but it also really disrespectful,” said first-year biology student Matt Camacho who identifies as a Catholic. “On this campus we preach versatility. We accept everybody. (The preachers berate) those that are not the same or aren’t part of the norm.” 
</p>

<p>
It is not unusual for students to come up and argue with the preachers. Some will argue for hours on end with them, others will read from alternative texts, and others will parody the doomsday style diction of preachers to humor friends and fellow students on Bruin Walk. Even professors engage with the preachers. In a well known incident from 2011, a professor cursed at a Bruin Walk preacher and walked away with his briefcase. 
</p>

<p>
For others the preachers are not just a joke. Many students think they disseminate an openly racist, sexist and homophobic agenda. Mark Drake, a fourth year math major who is a part of a queer Christian fellowship on campus said for example they have observed non-UCLA affiliated preachers call students sluts and carry signs singling out queer people’s lifestyle as sinful.

<p>
“I am offended the school is letting this happen,” Drake said. “I really don’t see any excuse for letting random, un-paying, unfriendly proslethetizers onto the campus.” 
</p>

<p>
UCLA statement 
</p>

<p>
    Steven Mion, a second year political science major who is also part of queer Christian fellowships on campus, said he thought while no one takes the preachers on Bruin Walk too seriously, it still makes him sad to see them preaching. 
</p>


<p>He feels they miss the message of love he has taken away from Christianity and instead use religion as a weapon, using props such as Isidro’s version of the Bible which has passages copy and pasted in it condemning gay people. At the same time, he said he does not feel personally offended by such behavior. 
</p>
<p>
    “If you reach the point where you are open enough to come out and be part of an openly queer Christian group, you generally have developed enough of that self validation and self affirmation that some fifty-year-old man with a cross saying that god hates (queer people) is probably just not going to resonate with you.” 
</p> 

<p>
    Tatsuo Akamine, an open air preacher who tries to come to campus about once a month, said he perceives student frustration with the preachers but he continues to come out to campus to provoke questions. He said he has consoled a number of students who identify as atheist about questions they have concerning the existence of God.
</p>

<p>
    “Hopefully it is the message I am presenting that people don’t like, and not the way I am presenting,” he said. 
</p>

<p>
    Jeanna Roe Smith, the campus minister for the United Methodist Identified Wesley Foundation said the foundation takes a radically different route to recruiting students. She said instead of trying to recruit through open air preaching, the organization functions mainly on word of mouth. 
</p>

<p>
    “(Open air preaching) is about power and imposing on somebody and forcing them into your opinion and your understanding. If you invite someone into a dialogue, if you are having an honest exchange of opinion, that is different,” she said. “They are so convinced people will burn in hell and they have to stop that. But that is when you confuse yourself for being the Holy Spirit and not just being a vessel of God.
</p> 

<p>
    She said her worst fear about the preachers on Bruin Walk is the negativity their words can trigger in students. She worries the preaching has the potential to bring up old memories where a student has been told they are other by their church and community for being different and that they do not belong. 
</p>

<p>
    “Even if you don’t try to engage with these people, those words can hit into your soul,” she said. “You may think you are okay, but the voice in your head starts to say ‘oh yeah I am a failure.’”

<p> 
    Rob Chew, the alumni campus resource for the Asian American Fellowship said he is not against open air preaching and that when done right can be helpful to telling people about the gospel, or the good news of Christ’s coming to provide forgiveness of sins for believers. He said good open air preaching is lovingly and kindly letting people know they are not perfect and have sin, but also sharing the hopeful message of the gospel.
</p>

<p>
    “In the same way a doctor would tell you ‘hey you have cancer’, they also say ‘but there is hope, there is operations we can do,’” Chew said. “I think that open air preaching can be helpful to let people know that there is a God and that he loves them. But having said that, I know that open air preaching is not always like that. I know there are people who are unloving, unkind.”
 </p>

<p>
    Chew said his fellowship does not do open air preaching, but instead does “cold contact evangelism,” which involves going up to people and trying to engage in one on one dialogues about the gospel. He said the fellowship does not participate in open air preaching, in part because of the stigma associated with those who do it as being belligerent and unloving.  
</p>

<p>
    He added the preachers students remember are the ones who are the loudest, most obnoxious and carry the most hateful signs, but that he has also seen Bruin Walk preachers who are more gentle and kind even though he sees them not nearly as often. 
</p>

<p>
    Miano said some preachers come to Bruin Walk with the express purpose of riling up student emotions by antagonizing certain groups of students and using inappropriate, overtly sexual language. In particular, he called out the quasi-celebrity campus minister Brother Jed, who is known to preach on Bruin Walk during finals week, as giving a bad name to Bruin Walk preachers. 
</p>

<p>
    Brother Jed could not be reached for an interview, but on his personal website, “BroJed.org,” he advertises controversial opinions such as the many female “strumpets, slatterns and trollops” that populate dorm buildings and characterizes queer men as having an average of 110 sexual partners a year. </p>
</p>

 <p>“Our message isn’t loved by all, in fact it is loved by few. But we try to do our best to let the offense by the message, the cross of Christ, and not our behavior,” Miano said.</p> 

extra

<p>Keenan Fine, a first-year economics student who is also Jewish said he has heard preachers communicate anti-Semitic remarks in addition to slurs aimed at queer students, which he said creates to an uncomfortable campus climate. </p>

<p>Christopher Gee, a pastor for Grace on Campus, a ministry serving the UCLA student community said that while the organization does not endorse name-calling, belittling, anger, or rudeness that often accompanies open-air preaching and sometimes those who preach miss the message of forgiveness advanced by Jesus Christ, it is not against open-air preaching done in a loving and kind way that matches the message of the Gospel. </p>

<p>“Open-air preaching may be weird and out of the ordinary, but it is that important to get the message of the Gospel out to people everywhere,” he said in a statement. <so how does he feel about the bruin walk preachers? which side of the coin do they fall on and why? <<don’t have much to work with here, look at the statement if you want when we meet later, but it doesn’t offer much in the way of specific thoughts of Bruin Walk preachers. Maybe this source gets cut. </p>
